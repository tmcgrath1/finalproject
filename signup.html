    Before you can win, you must be officially 
    registered in the competition. Fortunately, you can do 
    that in about 5 minutes from your phone or computer. </strong></p>
    
    <p><strong>Register on the website.</strong> When registering we highly recommend using your 
    LinkedIN, Google+, or Facebook account to speed up the process. 
    After logging in the first time, you will be asked a few questions about yourself, 
    starting with general questions like your name, etc.,  and then more specific questions about 
    your class, major, and skills & experience. 
    <strong> You will not be registered to compete</strong> until your profile is complete. If your
     registration gets interrupted, you can resume
     it by logging in again by the same method you used before. 
    The system will then prompt you to complete your registration.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Confirm your eligibility to win. </strong> The eligibility rules are given
     in the Rules & Policies section of the Competitors Guide.
     Please free to contact us to discuss any questions about your eligibility. </p>
     
     <p><strong> Polish up your public directory profile.</strong> Once registered, you can take 
     your time spiffing up your public profile that will be published in the competition directory. 
     <strong> Log in using whatever method (LinkedIN, Google+, Facebook, username/password) you used to register. </strong>
     (Note: this is very important; if you choose another method then you may end up with two accounts and lots of confusion 
     later on.) Then you can change your picture, craft your skills & experience entry, and even add social links to your profile
      listing. (Instructions for each of these things are given in the FAQs.)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Ask lots of questions.</strong>There is a lot of material here on the website, which can make things confusing
       sometimes, especially in the beginning. So speak up when that happens! Your questions will help us make it better for you 
       and everyone who comes after you. If you don't know who to ask, use our Contact Us page to email your question, and we'll
        get it to the right person.</p>
